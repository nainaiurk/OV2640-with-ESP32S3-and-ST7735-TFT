# Smooth Navigation Improvements

## Changes Made

### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved**
- **Before**: Menu navigation caused screen flicker and full redraws
- **After**: Smooth navigation with only selection highlight updates
- **Result**: Professional, responsive UI without visual disruption

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

#### New Functions Added:
1. **`update_menu_selection()`** - Updates only the main menu highlight
2. **`update_game_menu_selection()`** - Updates only the game menu highlight

#### Button System Improvements:
- **Direct button reading**: `digitalRead(pin) == LOW` for maximum responsiveness
- **Removed debounce delays**: No artificial delays for gaming applications
- **Snake game input handling**: Added frame-based input processing to prevent erratic movement

#### Menu Navigation Optimizations:
- **Selective redraw**: Only updates the changed menu items instead of entire screen
- **Eliminated flicker**: No more `tft.fillScreen()` calls during navigation
- **Preserved visual elements**: Title, borders, and layout remain stable

### ðŸ“± **User Experience Improvements**

#### Before:
- Screen cleared and redrawn on every button press
- Visible flicker during navigation
- Slower response due to full screen redraws
- Less professional appearance

#### After:
- **Instant response** to button presses
- **Smooth highlighting** of menu options
- **No screen flicker** or clearing
- **Professional console-style navigation**
