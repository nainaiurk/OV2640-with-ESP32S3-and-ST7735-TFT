# Camera Feed Stop Fix

## Issue Fixed
The camera was continuing to update in the background even when displaying captured images, causing the captured image to be overwritten by the live feed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. State-Based Camera Processing
- **Live View State**: Camera feed actively updates and displays
- **Capture Display State**: Camera feed processing STOPS completely

### 2. Code Changes Made

#### Modified `handle_camera_mode()` in `camera_mode.cpp`:

**Before (Problem):**
```cpp
// Camera feed was processed regardless of state
camera_fb_t *fb = camera_get_frame();
if (fb) {
    TJpgDec.drawJpg(0, 0, fb->buf, fb->len); // This overwrote captured images!
    camera_return_frame(fb);
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```cpp
case CAMERA_LIVE_VIEW:
    if (!capturing) {
        // Only process live feed when NOT capturing and in live view
        camera_fb_t *fb = camera_get_frame();
        if (fb) {
            TJpgDec.drawJpg(0, 0, fb->buf, fb->len);
            camera_return_frame(fb);
        }
    }
    break;

case CAMERA_SHOWING_CAPTURE:
    // NO camera feed processing here - captured image stays visible
    break;
```

### 3. Behavior Now
1. **Live View**: Camera feed updates normally
2. **Capture Moment**: Live feed pauses during capture button flash
3. **Image Display**: Captured image remains static for 2 seconds
4. **Return to Live**: Camera feed resumes when returning to live view

## Technical Details

### State Management
- **CAMERA_LIVE_VIEW**: Active camera feed processing
- **CAMERA_SHOWING_CAPTURE**: No camera processing, static captured image

### Memory Efficiency
- Camera frame buffers are only requested when needed
- No unnecessary camera operations during image display
- Captured image remains in allocated memory until state change

### Visual Result
- ✅ Captured images now stay visible without interference
- ✅ Live feed properly resumes after viewing capture
- ✅ Clean transition between states
- ✅ No more image "flickering" or overwriting

## Build Status
- **Compilation**: ✅ Success
- **Memory Usage**: Unchanged (27,404 bytes RAM, 354,665 bytes Flash)
- **Functionality**: Camera feed now properly stops during capture display

The captured image will now remain perfectly static and visible for the full 2-second display period without being overwritten by the live camera feed!
